Project description:

For project 1 we were tasked with making two separate C programs:

The first being a program called matrixmul.c that took two input matrices from the user with
dimensions 1<= n,k,m <= 300. Then outputted the resulting matrix of the multiplication, assuming that
the dimensions were compatible to be multiplied.

The second program was called encrypt.c which used a simple simple transposition cipher that works
by dividing the string in half and swapping the subsets of the string using a recursive method.
********************************************************************************************************

Group member contribution (such as member1: 50%, member2: 50%):

Brandon: 50%, Anastasiya: 50%

Compiling instruction:
First we logged into the linux lab via Bitvise SSH.
Then we navigated to where our program files were located after copying the over.
To compile the code we used the corresponding command:
gcc matrixmul.c -o matrixmul
gcc encrypt.c -o encrypt

this then produced two executable files named correspondingly,
to run each program we individually typed:
./matrixmul
./encrypt

the following output can be seen below:

Existing bugs (things not finished):
There are no existing bugs that we are aware of. The only issue that we ran into was that a windows
machine uses a different compiler than gcc and also seemingly a different null terminator for strings.
Because we had weird formatting issues with the output of encrypt.c when using microsoft visual studio
but when running on the linux lab, the output was as expected.
