<h4>Project6: An Improved Shell (Due at 11:59:59pm on 12/05/2019 (EST))</h4>

<h4 class="new"><a href="http://galois.cs.csuohio.edu/teaching/cis340fa19/projects/p5s1_group.txt">Group Arrangment.</a></h4>

<p>Based on the shell program you have developed in project5, you are asked to 
improve your shell to support several I/O redirection.  You are expected to use C programming language.  
Your implementation must work on Linux machine in FH131 lab.  </p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
I. Extra Features:</span><br>

<ol>
<li>(50 points) Support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29">
pipeline (|)</a>.  Given the following command,
<pre>$ MYSHELL: cmd1 arg1 arg2 ... | cmd2 arg1 arg2 ... | cmd3 arg1 agr2 ...</pre>
the standard output
of <tt>cmd1</tt> is connected to the standard input of <tt>cmd2</tt>, and the standard output of
<tt>cmd2</tt> is connected to the standard input of <tt>cmd3</tt>.
<ul>
<li>You may want to use <tt>pipe()</tt> system call.</li>
<li>You may assume at most two pipeline operators (|) in my test command while grading.  Actually,
it is easy to remove this assumption and your shell should handle unlimited number of "|"s. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> (20 points) Support Input Redirection. Your shell should support input redirection.  In particular,
if the following command is entered:
<pre>$ MYSHELL: cmd1 arg1 arg2 ... &lt; myfile
</pre>
The input of process cmd1 will be redirected to a local file named "myfile". 
</li> 

<li>(20 points) Support Output Redirection. Your shell should support output redirection. 
In particular, if the following command is entered:
<pre>$ MYSHELL: cmd1 arg1 arg2 ... &gt; myfile
</pre>
The screen output will be redirected to a local file named "myfile". This redirection
capability should work for all commands in your shell.
</li>
<li>Bonus: (10 points) You will earn the bonus points if your shell supports the combination of pipeline, input and output redirection.  For example:
<pre>$ MYSHELL: cmd1 arg1 arg2 ... &lt; file1 | cmd2 arg1 ... | cmd3 arg1 ... &gt; file2 
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Note1: the above arguments: arg1, arg2, and etc, are optional.  Your shell should not be restrictive on how many arguments being supported.  
</li>
<li>Note2: the above extension only works with non-internal commands, and should not work with
internal commands: cd, path and quit.
</li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
II. Documentations:</span><br>
<ul>
<li>Provide a Makefile so <tt>make</tt> command would produce the executable.</li>
<li>
(10 points) Readme: you are required to write a README document (TXT only) that
describes your project design detail and the execution sequence (with the commands).
In particular, please explicitly state which part, if there is any, does not work and 
the possible reasons why that module does not work.  For those working modules, please give
a brief (in short) sample output.
</li>
</ul>



<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
III. Submission:</span><br>

<ul>
<li>Create a folder with the name of your assigned group name, e.g., group1.</li>
<li>Copy all source code files/directories into the created folder.</li>
<li>Make sure you have sshed to grail.eecs.csuohio.edu, and then type:<br> 
<tt> $ turnin -c cis340w -p p6s1 group1</tt></li>
</ul>
