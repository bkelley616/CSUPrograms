<h4>Project5: A Simple Shell (Due at 11:59:59pm on 11/18/2019 (EST))</h4>

<h4 class="new"><a href="http://galois.cs.csuohio.edu/teaching/cis340fa19/projects/p5s1_group.txt">Group Arrangment.</a></h4>

<p>You are asked to implement a simple shell that supports Linux shell commands in addition to the internal commands.  You are expected to use C programming language.  
Your implementation must work on Linux machine in FH131 lab.  </p>

<h4> Required Modules: </h4>
<ol>
<li>(60 points) Your shell should repeatedly display a prompt and allow 
the user to enter a command to run.  Your shell is supposed to read the input
from system standard input, parse the line with command and arguments, and execute.
You must use <tt>fork()</tt> and <tt>exec*()</tt> system calls.
<ul>
<li>Your shell should find the internal commands (see part2) first.  If not found, it 
should search the directories in the shell's
pathname environment (see part2).</li>
<li>You are not allowed to use system(), as it invokes the system's /bin/sh shell.
You cannot use <tt>execlp()</tt> or <tt>execvp()</tt>, because your shell has its own path 
variable (explained in part2).
</li><li>By convention, the command arguments are seperated by white spaces.  Please
describe your customized argument seperation rules in your README document 
if you have special arrangement (not recommended though).  Your shell does not
need to handle special characters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(30 points) Implement the following three additional internal commands (running in the main
process rather than the child process).
<ul>
<li><tt>cd</tt>: is a command, obviously, to change directories.  You are required to use the chdir system call.</li>
<li><tt>path</tt>: is not only a command to show the current command searching pathnames 
(if no argument is provided), but also a utility to modify (either add or remove) the 
command searching pathnames.
<ul>
<li><tt>path (without arguments)</tt> displays the pathnames currently set.  e.g., "/bin:/sbin".  Initially, the pathnames are empty (so you have to manually use "path" command to construct your pathnames in the runtime.</li>
<li><tt>path + /abc/def</tt> appends the pathname "/abc/def" to the "path" variable.  e.g., 
"/bin:/sbin:/abc/def".</li>
<li><tt>path - /abc/def</tt> removes the pathname "/abc/def" from the "path" variable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt>quit</tt>: is a command to leave the shell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your shell gives a meaningful response to an undefined command and wait for the next input. Your program has a clean compile with no warning.  You are not allowed to use "gcc -w" option to supress the warnings.</li>
<li>
(10 points) Makefile and README: Provide a Makefile so <tt>make</tt> command would produce the executable.
You are required to write a README document (TXT only) that
describes your project design detail and the execution sequence (with the commands).
In particular, please explicitly state which part, if there is any, does not work and 
the possible reasons why that module does not work.  For those working modules, please give
a brief (in short) sample output.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Submission:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create a folder with the name of your assigned group name, e.g., group1.</li>
<li>Copy all source code files/directories into the created folder.</li>
<li>Include a group picture file (in JPG format) in your submission folder.</li>
<li>Make sure you have sshed to grail.eecs.csuohio.edu, and then type:<br> 
<tt> $ turnin -c cis340w -p p5s1 group1</tt></li>
</ul>
