  1. Create a procedure that generates a random string of length L, containing all capital letters. When calling the
     procedure, pass the value of L in EAX, and pass a pointer to an array of byte that will hold the random string.
     Write a test program that calls your procedure 20 times and displays the strings in the console window.

  2. Revise the encryption program that you have worked on last Friday in the following manner:

        • Create an encryption key consisting of multiple characters.

        • Use this key to encrypt and decrypt the plaintext by XORing each character of
          the key against a corresponding byte in the message.

        • Repeat the key as many times as necessary until all plain text bytes are translated.

        • Suppose, for example, the key was equal to “ABXmv#7”. This is how the key would align
          with the plain text bytes:

  3.  Create a procedure named CalcGrade that receives an integer value between 0 and 100 and returns a single
      capital letter in the AL register. Preserve all other register values between calls to the procedure. The
      letter returned by the procedure should be according to the following ranges:

      Write a test program that generates 10 random integers between 50 and 100, inclusive. Each time an integer is
      generated, pass it to the CalcGrade procedure. You can test your program using a debugger, or if you prefer to
      use the book’s library, you can display each integer and its corresponding letter grade. (The Irvine32 library
      is required for this solution program because it uses the RandomRange procedure).

  4. Banks use a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to uniquely identify each customer. Let us assume that our
     bank has a specified range of acceptable values for each digit in its customers’ 5-digit PINs. The table
     shown below contains the acceptable ranges, where digits are numbered from left to right in the PIN.
     Then we can see that the PIN 52413 is valid. But the PIN 43534 is invalid because the first digit is out of range.

     Your task is to create a procedure named Validate_PIN that receives a pointer to an array of byte containing
     a 5-igit PIN. Declare two arrays to hold the minimum and maximum range values and use these arrays to validate
     each digit of the PIN that was passed to the procedure. If any digit is found to be outside its valid range,
     immediately return the digit’s position (between 1 and 5) in the EAX register.
     If the entire PIN is valid, return 0 in EAX. Preserve all other register values between calls to the procedure.
     Write a test program that calls Validate_PIN at least four times, using both valid and invalid byte arrays.
     By running the program in a debugger, display "Valid" or "Invalid" on the console after each procedure call.
