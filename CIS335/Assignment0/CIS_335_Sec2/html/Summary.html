<h2>Summary of major, goals for this course and programming/HTML experience:</h2>
<pre> <p>
    I am a computer science major with junior standing. I went to Tri-C
  during my senior of Highschool full-time so with the addition of some summer
  classes, I was able to skip a year. I am currently following the standard
  degree track after taking CIS 265 data structures and Engineering Economy
  over the summer.

    My goals for this course is undertand and develop a greater understanding
  of how computers and there software work on a low level. Meanwhile learning
  about things such as binary, hexadecimal, etc. In addition, I would
  like to learn how to become a proficient programmer of Assembly Language.
  This should help me in my overall understanding of how software and a computer
  interact with one another.

    I obviously have the standard programming experience that comes with being
  at CSU which mainly focuses on the Java Language (CIS260/265). In addition
  to that standard experience I have done some personal learning on my own.
  This personal learning mainly came in the form of online classes from a
  website called <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">udacity</a>. From udacity, I have taken courses in python,
  android(Java/XML),HTML/CSS, and Javascript. Some personal projects of mine
  include publishing and android application to the google playstore that
  has 1k+ downloads and 350 active users. In addition to a porfolio website
  you can find <a href="https://bk-csu.webflow.io/">here</a>.

<h2>Paragraph demonstrating the use of italics, bold, code formats, and the
use of Greek letters and matmematical symbols:
</h2>
<pre> <p>
  HTML formatting techniques:

  To make text italic, use the &lt;i&gt; tag: <i>This is italic</i>
  To make text bold, use the &lt;b&gt; tag: <b>This is bold</b>

  To represent text as code, be sure to use the &lt;code&gt; tag.
  Additionally, to preserve any formatting in terms of spacing, user
  the &lt;pre&gt; tag. Here is an example of an hello world program
  java:

  <code>

    class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}

  </code>

  To display greek characters you can use the corrosponding &amp;(greek character);
  Be sure not to forget the ";" after the ampersand followed by the word!

  This (&amp;Theta;) will display a theta character &Theta;
  This (&amp;Delta;) will display a delta character &Delta;


  We can represent mathmatical symbols in the same way we represent greek characters,
  by using each symbols corrosponding code in the following format &amp;(math symbol);
  Be sure not to forget the ";" after the ampersand followed by the word!
  
    This (&amp;Pi;) will display pi symbol &Pi;
    This (&amp;Infin;) will display the infinity symbol &infin;
