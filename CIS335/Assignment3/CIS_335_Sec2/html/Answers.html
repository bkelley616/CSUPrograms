  1. In the following code, the value in AL is intended to be a signed byte. Explain how the Overflow flag helps, or
     does not help you, to determine whether the final value in AL falls within a valid signed range.

            mov al,-1
            add al,130

        <font color = red>Answer:

            A signed byte (8-bits) has a range of -128 to 127. The instructions above perform the expression
            -1 + 130  this evaluates to = 129. Since this value is outside of the range, the overflow flag
            is therfore set. This allows you to determine that the final Value in AL is outside the valid range.

  2. Where indicated, write down the values of the Carry, Sign, Zero, and Overflow flags after each
  instruction has executed:

        mov ax,7FF0h
        add al,10h  ; a. CF =  SF =  ZF =  OF =
        add ah,1  ; b. CF =  SF =  ZF =  OF =
        add ax,2  ; c. CF =  SF =  ZF =  OF =



        <font color = red>Answer:

            a. CF = 1     SF = 0     ZF = 1     OF = 0

            b. CF = 0     SF = 1     ZF = 0     OF = 1

            c. CF = 0     SF = 1     ZF = 0     OF = 0

          </font>


  3. What will EAX contain after the following instructions execute?

        .data
            .dVal DWORD ?
        .code
              mov dVal,12345678h
              mov ax,WORD PTR dVal+2
              add ax,3
              mov WORD PTR dVal,ax
              mov eax,dVal

        <font color = red>Answer:

          EAX = 12375678h

          </font>


  4. What will be the value of the destination operand after each of the following instructions execute in sequence?

    .data
        var1 SBYTE -4,-2,3,1
        var2 WORD 1000h,2000h,3000h,4000h
        var3 SWORD -16,-42
        var4 DWORD 1,2,3,4,5

    .code
        mov edx,var4   ;a.
        movzx edx,var2 ;b.
        mov edx,[var4+4]  ;c.
        movsx edx,var1  ;d.


        <font color = red>Answer:

          a. 00000001h

          b. 00001000h

          c. 00000002h

          d. FFFFFFFCh

  5. Write an assembly program that inputs a student’s score and prints her/his grade. The student
     will be “Excellent” if her/his score is between 90‐100, “Very Good” if the score is between
     80‐89, “Good” if the score is between 70‐79, “Fair” if the score is between 60‐69, and “Fail”
     if the score is lower than 60. (Assume scores are integers.)

  6. Write a program that uses a loop to calculate the first seven values of the Fibonacci number sequence,
      described by the following formula:

      Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1, Fib(n) = Fib(n -1) + Fib(n - 2)

  7. Using the XCHG instruction no more than three times,
      reorder the values in four 8-bit registers from the order A,B,C,D to C,B,D,A.

        <font color = red>Answer:

          ;Letters represented by respective registers
          ; A = al B = bl C = cl D = dl

          ;start A,B,C,D

          xchg A, C ; C,B,A,D
          xchg A, D ; C,B,D,A

  8. Write code using byte operands that adds two negative integers and causes the Overflow flag to be set.

          <font color = red>Answer:

            ; Book Definition: The Overﬂow ﬂag (OF) is set when the result of a signed arithmetic
            ; operation is too large or too small to ﬁt into the destination.

            ;using signed arithmetic with 8 bits range is -128 to 127

            ;too small case
            mov  al,-100
            add  al,-100
            ;OF = 1

            ;too big case
            mov  al,100
            add  al,100
            ;OF = 1

  9. Write a program with a loop and indirect addressing that copies a string from source to target,
     reversing the character order in the process. Use the following variables:

        source BYTE "This is the CIS 335 Sec 2",0
        target BYTE SIZEOF source DUP('0')

  10. Write a program with a loop and indexed addressing that calculates the sum of all the gaps
      between successive array elements. The array elements are doublewords, sequenced in nondecreasing order.
      So, for example, the array {0, 2, 5, 9, 10} has gaps of 2, 3, 4, and 1, whose sum equals 10.
