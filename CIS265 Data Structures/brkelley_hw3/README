Compiling and run instruction

I first logged into the linux lab using bitvise, upon doing so I ran the following command:

javac Testish.java

after compiling the code I then tested and ran the code using the following command:

java Testish unfriendly
java Testish elf unfriendly
java Testish els unfriendly
java Testish

**the program itself is ran from "java Testish" but since the program takes string arguments, we have the
option to also include arguments afterwords. I tested the given examples to be able to provide a sample output
I tested a few additonal cases which also functioned as expected**


A sample test run (again in text) **following same order as above run examples (teacher given example)**

unfriendly is elfish
unfriendly contains elf
unfriendly does not contain els
Please provide one or two strings


Existing bug (things not finished)

There are no bugs in my program and the assignment went well. My main issues were establishing the logic needed
for the recursion, and realising that you can pass in arguments from where you run the program in the terminal
I initially thought I needed a scanner for keyboard input from the command line. It also took a lot of looking at the
java String api to figure out how I could use the correct methods.

** I wanted to note that I commented the code quite a bit which I was told was ok for the last assignment,
I feel like this assignment had more difficult logic so I felt the need to explain for myself and the implied "user"
of the code, what each part did in detail. **
