Compiling instruction:

To compile the code on the command line in linux. I had to first remote into the linux lab using bitvise
next, I ran these commands:

javac Test.java
javac BankAccount.java
javac Payable.java
javac SavingAccount.java
javac CheckingAccount.java
javac GiftCard.java

to run the code, I then executed the Test file using (this is where the main method is located):

java Test


A sample test run (again in text):

Unable to complete transaction, withdraw amount is greater than current balance
Successful withdraw of $800.0
Successful withdraw of $800.0
Payment of $2000.0 made to Alonso

Existing bug (things not finished):

There weren't any bugs that I couldn't work out.
The only main issues I had to solve were overriding the default To String method
to produce the correct formatting when the objects are printed out.
Also didn't realise I needed to have "concrete" deposit and withdraw methods in bank account
but my code wouldn't compile until I figured that out and solved it.
Also needed to figure out how to generate a number of a specified size randomly, that took some time and research.
Overall the Assignment went well.
