Compiling instruction

To compile I typed these commands into the terminal.

javac F150.java
javac Truck.java
javac LandVehicle.java
javac Vehicle.java

to run I then typed:

java F150

I got the following output.


A sample test run (again in text)

Vehicle no-arg constructor is invoked.
LandVehicle no-arg constructor is invoked.
Truck's overloaded constructor is invoked.
Truck's no-arg constructor is invoked.
F150 no-arg constructor is invoked.


Existing bug (things not finished)

N/A used what I remembered going over/notes in class to do assignment.
