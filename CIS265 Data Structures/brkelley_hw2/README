Compiling and run instruction

I first use bitvise to connect to linux lab.
Once in the terminal I run the following commands to compile the code:
javac HeartRate.java
javac HRIllegalValueException.java

then I made sure the HR.txt file is in the same directory as my code

to run and test my code I do the following command (HeartRate contains the main method):

java HeartRate

it then produces the correct output as seen below


A sample test run (again in text)

HRIllegalValueException: Input can't be negative.
HRIllegalValueException: Input can't be negative.
Good Data: 24
Bad Data: 6


Existing bug (things not finished)

There are no bugs in my program, my main difficulty was figuring out how to "consume"
the bad data. But overall the assignment went well
