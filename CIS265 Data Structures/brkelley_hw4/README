Program compiling and program execution instruction:

I first logged into the csu linux lab using bitvise,
next I compiled all the code files using the following commands:

javac IStack.java
javac ArrayStack.java
javac StackFullException.java
javac Evaluate.java

after compiling, I ran the code with the following command:

java Evaluate

This is because the Evaluate method contains the main method, I then use
my program by typing in user input.

***************************************************************************************
A sample test run (again in text)

Please enter an expression to be solved,
to exit the program, type "exit"

14-3*4+2*5-6*2

Solving: 14-3*4+2*5-6*2
Answer: 0

Existing bug (things not finished)

** note I set my program up to run multiple times (while loop)
to exit the user types "exit", my reasoning is because
I believe this is more user friendly and acts more realistically
as a calculator application**

There are no bugs that I am aware of, assignment went well but took me a good amount of time
comparatively speaking. I was not able to implement the parentheses for extra credit but left in
the commented code of my attempt. reason being, I may expand upon this assignment to make my own
calculator app for android
